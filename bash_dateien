BASH_PROFILE VS. PROFILE VS BASHRC

    ~/.bash_profile should be super-simple and just load .profile and .bashrc (in that order)

    ~/.profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as environment variables (PATH and friends)

    ~/.bashrc has anything you'd want at an interactive command line. Command prompt, EDITOR variable, bash aliases for my use

A few other notes:

    Anything that should be available to graphical applications OR to sh (or bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile

    ~/.bashrc must not output anything

    Anything that should be available only to login shells should go in ~/.profile

    Ensure that ~/.bash_login does not exist.





!!!!! FOR MAC USERS


Note: The Xterm application installed as part of Xquartz runs .bashrc when a new window opens, 
not .bash_profile. Other third-party terminal applications on macOS may follow the precedent set by Terminal.app or not.
